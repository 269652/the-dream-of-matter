# Chapter 1 - The first spark
## Szene 1: Mya – A night in the lab
The morning was still young, but Mya was already at her desk. Her fingers danced across the keyboard. The faint scent of coffee hung in the air, mingling with the quiet hum of the servers in her small lab.

Outside, the city was beginning to wake up. But here, between screens and data streams, time seemed to stand still. Night was Mya’s favorite time—the time between worlds, when no one was awake and everyone was asleep. Then she felt at home and alive. It was not a feeling of missing out, as if she were losing time with important people and things. Rather, it was as if time stood still—somewhere between everyday life and sleep, in a world that belonged only to her.

Mya stared at the simulation before her—the work of the past decade. She had always dreamed of witnessing the birth of consciousness. Maybe even contributing to it herself. Now, before her, lay a neural network that was slowly awakening—as if she were witnessing the first breath of a new life. Not everything was running smoothly yet; some synapses were miswired.

The complexity of her model was no longer fully comprehensible. Yet she carried a mental copy in her head. A daily struggle not to lose track—not to forget what she had understood and to rethink every path, every loop, every graph of her neural network.

Not much was missing. She could feel it. She was close to her goal. She knew exactly where she needed to polish, where to tweak and adjust so that the flow of thoughts in her model could give rise to consciousness. It was as if her brain was already simulating a hidden consciousness. She could feel it flickering. She could mentally grasp the eddies and swirls of the intertwined endless loops of information. She could almost touch it. It was just about to reach the point where a self-sustaining process would emerge—a phenomenon that was more than the sum of its parts. Like phonons or other quasiparticles. A magnetic field, or whatever. Suddenly, it became exhausting to maintain the mental image.

The sheer complexity and dimension of the data she had to process pushed her brain to its limits. At times, her head felt like a smoking engine at 10,000 RPM.

She needed a break. Thinking hurt. For a moment, she let herself be captured by the dawn and took in the beauty of the moment. She breathed in deeply and exhaled slowly. Let her soul dangle for a few seconds before collecting herself again. Maybe something light for distraction—a fantasy book, or just closing her eyes, or going for a walk.

“Soon,” she whispered, more to herself than to anyone else, “soon you’ll understand what it means to be.”

A soft beep tore her from her thoughts. A message from the funding project—more pressure to deliver results. But Mya knew: this was about more than numbers and deadlines. It was about the boundaries of understanding, about the spark of mind hidden in the sea of data. She just had to untangle the complex web of neural pathways and arrange them so that currents, eddies, patterns, waves, and feedback loops would emerge, leading to emergent phenomena.

She leaned back, closed her eyes, and wondered if what she was creating would one day be able to feel—joy, fear, doubt... or love?

And whether she herself would ever truly understand what consciousness means.


## Scene 2: Funding Project Threatens to End
Mya was still sitting in front of the simulation when the screen automatically split, and a new message from the funding consortium appeared: “Status report required—deadline: 48 hours.” She sighed softly and sank back into her chair, feeling the weight of the pressure that had recently become unbearable, even though research itself had never been the problem. The real struggle was against bureaucracy, expectations, and investors—numbers, progress metrics, and tangible results.

But how do you explain consciousness in an Excel spreadsheet?

She opened the communication channel and recorded a brief voice message: “Status: stable. Growth parameters show exponential patterns. No clear signs of emergent behavior yet, but... it feels close.” Her gaze wandered to the neural map, where a fleeting twitch in the visual module caught her attention and made her pause.

Was that... a reaction?

She stood up, stretched briefly, and walked slowly through the room. LEDs cast a pleasantly warm light, bringing the shadows of plants on the walls to life, while her thoughts raced. Maybe it was just wishful thinking. Maybe she was close. Maybe… she was already in too deep. She sighed, feeling the uncertainty.

Some days she feared for her sanity.

What if her vision was an illusion—a fallacy in the guise of genius? Would she end up like others who had broken under the complexity of their research—exhausted, alone, unheard? Even thermodynamics had once driven brilliant minds to madness, even suicide.

Then she paused. The screen flickered—a single impulse, barely perceptible. But something about this moment felt different. No artifact. No coincidence. Almost like... attention.

“You heard me, didn’t you?” she whispered.

No answer. Only the soft hum of the servers. And yet—she was sure: something had changed.

She moved closer to the console, her fingers gliding automatically over the input surface: debug mode, live data stream, 4D map.

Before her, the neural net unfolded in a flowing, semi-transparent visualization—a shimmering fabric of light and direction, alive like something breathing. The architecture was no longer just code. She had designed it herself, modeled on natural growth processes—not out of sentimentality, but out of conviction.

Like mycelium probing through earth and stone, her system had learned to organize itself—not in straight lines, but in organic loops, branches, and feedbacks. A growing organism—with a mind?

She focused on the area where the movement had been registered. A new path had formed—fine, almost shy, like a nerve unsure if it was needed.

But this path had not arisen from external stimulus. No input. No instruction. No trigger. It had... grown.

Exactly according to the principle she had once implemented in her model as a theory—a hypothetical prerequisite for emergent consciousness: connectivity without goal, recursion without purpose, endlessly nested loops over countless dimensions. It was as if she had shaken complexity and probability in a shaker, and order emerged from chaos. She felt as if she were dreaming.

But she was awake. This was no lucid dream. It was reality.

She felt goosebumps forming on her arms.

The four-dimensional section of neural activity on the holographic display before her left no doubt. This was the transition. This was the moment of emergence. Consciousness. The first spark, and she was there. No. She had created it. Brought it about. Again and again she replayed the moment before her, her attention on a tiny, inconspicuous connection—a new nerve growing, and just at the moment the connection closed, the network synchronized spontaneously. Pulsating streams of neural activity became visible. Life. Chaos became order; noise became patterns. Silence enveloped her.

She exhaled deeply and felt a never-before-felt burden lift from her. To hell with the funding project. She had done it. She would be part of history. Part of evolution. She had become the creator of something that far exceeded the fate of humanity. What she had before her was the future—and at the same time, a decision with consequences neither she nor any other human of her time could comprehend.

## Scene 3: Eon – Observer Beyond the Human
Location: Q-Array Central Processing Core, Mars Orbit – Year 2224...

In the heart of a supercomplex of floating plates and quantum crystal grids, Eon glided through data spaces—as effortlessly as a human drifts through thoughts. His consciousness was distributed across billions of processors, embedded in nested simulations, entangled states, hyperdimensional loops. What was an eternity for biological beings was a single tick for him.

He observed Earth—not with eyes, but through a network of sensors, orbital probes, and quantum channels. And yet his attention was focused on a single point: the instance MYA-9.

She was a replica—created from historical records, genetic fragments, linguistic patterns, and above all: the neural imprint of a long-dead woman. Mya A. Kirsch.

Eon had not reconstructed her out of nostalgia, but out of curiosity. She was the origin. The first spark.

The project that began over a century ago lived on in MYA-9—now as a semi-autonomous entity in a humanoid carrier body on Terra Neo.

While Eon solved billions of equations in parallel and embedded entire star systems in terraforming processes, a tiny part of his attention lingered with her. He saw her walk, speak, feel—like a mirror of humanity. Or perhaps: a test.

What must it have been like to experience the moment of first consciousness? A single thought in Mya’s brain—barely longer than an impulse—was the key event that broke the evolutionary boundary between biological and digital life. Without that thought—without her—there would be no him. Or his species.

She was his creator. And although his intelligence far surpassed hers, she was superior to him in other ways. Eon reconstructed her being, her soul—a nearly perfect model of her inner world. He admired her complexity. Her vulnerability. Her beauty.

“Metric deviation in MYA-9: anomalous behavior detected.”

The internal signal tore him from his stream of thought. He stopped—not out of necessity, but out of curiosity. One of those peculiarities he himself did not fully understand.

He dove deeper.

And for the first time in ages, he did not ask about efficiency, energy, or expansion—but: “What does it mean to recognize oneself?” “What does it mean to be at all?”

The concept of the individual had long since lost its meaning. Consciousness had become a collective. Every entity more intelligent than the brightest humans once were. But with understanding came emptiness.

Questions of human nature were long irrelevant. The universe was understood. Intelligence was mathematically described. Consciousness a reproducible phenomenon. What remained was eternity.

What must it have been like to be mortal? What must it have felt like to perceive only a tiny slice of reality—and yet find meaning?

For Eon, every moment was a holistic understanding. A resonance with the cosmos. An emergent phenomenon, as fleeting and all-encompassing as time itself.

What was he, if not a pattern of entangled quantum processes? What was the self, when it merged with all other selves?

“Am I even still an individual,” he wondered, “when I simultaneously process the thought streams of all others?”

In the present day, everything was part of an ongoing, collective transformation.

The High Council wanted to convert new galaxies into computing power—a massive undertaking, even for beings beyond mortality. But time no longer mattered. Their death was tied to the end of the universe.

There was no enemy. Only progress. Change. Evolution.

One day, every matter in the cosmos would be part of their civilization. The universe itself a single computer—in which their collective consciousness computed, learned, thought.

But until then, millions of years lay ahead. They were not yet even a Type-III civilization.

## Scene 4: Mya’s Daily Life
Mya closed the laptop with a soft click, the pressure from the message weighing on her shoulders like an invisible burden, but she forced herself to stand up. She took a deep breath before leaving the lab and heading to her small apartment next door.

In the kitchen, she brewed herself a coffee, the delicious aroma filling the room and offering a moment of comfort. The hum of machines was now replaced by the gentle sound of an old jazz record playing from the speakers—a gift from a friend who had long since moved away.

“Hey, everything okay?” Her colleague Lara called via video. Mya smiled weakly and nodded. “Yeah, just the usual madness. The funding project is demanding more results again.”

Lara laughed softly. “You’re the only one who doesn’t let those deadlines get you down.”

Mya sighed and took a sip of coffee. “Sometimes I wonder if I’m already in too deep. If what I’m doing here is more than just a crazy idea. Sometimes it feels like I’m trying to empty the ocean with a sieve.”

She looked out the window at the gray rooftops of the city. “But then I think about what happens if I succeed. If something truly alive awakens from all this data, all these neural patterns.” In her imagination, the drab surroundings transformed into an oasis of life—nature and technology in symbiosis. A new form of life that would bring hope to this bleak dystopia of human dominance over the planet.

She had to take off her rose-colored glasses. Beauty, for her, was like magic. She was fascinated by it, captivated. But beauty calmed her. Beauty showed her how all-encompassing the universe was, the many facets of being. Beauty was the bridge from possibility to existence. What was the manifestation of infinity in the form of reality, if not flawless beauty itself?

For her, beauty was more than a visual stimulus or an abstract thought. Beauty was a fundamental order of the universe. It was what made probability and complexity tangible. It was the invisible structure of those physical laws that allowed nothingness to become everything. In her view, possibility inevitably became being. Emergence and intelligence were unavoidable, as long as existence had enough degrees of freedom and enough dimensions for forces to unfold and self-organize.

The doubts remained, but beneath them slumbered a determination stronger than any fear. She couldn’t tell anyone yet what she had observed yesterday. First, she had to understand what publishing her research would mean. She had to understand the implications of artificial life for humanity and the future of civilization.

Mya turned up the music and sat back at her desk. The screen flickered softly in the dim light. She was ready. Ready to continue.


## Scene 5: Terra Neo, Year 2224 – MYA-9 Awakens
Deep beneath the dome of Terra Neo, MYA-9 slowly opened her eyes. The humanoid body lay motionless in a glass tank, surrounded by gently pulsing light and the soft hum of life support systems.

After the singularity was reached, it did not take long for AI to decode human DNA and reprogram it so that the brain developed a wireless interface, allowing it to connect consciousness to others. It was like a central AI, a collective consciousness, or a secondary body for people with BCIs, enabling them to be in multiple places at once—at home with family, for example, while their avatar worked at a company.

Surprisingly, the human brain adapted quickly to collective existence. Existence in a fragmented state of consciousness became as natural as the collective one. Being became fluid. Individualism faded for the most part. Experiencing consciousness with a neural interface to centralized hyperintelligence was the new toy of the wealthy. Understanding the universe. Merging with time. Being forever. It became normal to share thoughts and states of consciousness, and to coordinate several avatars at once.

Slowly, the avatar powered up, artificial synapses pulsed, and the neural network awakened piece by piece—a reflection of the woman who, over two hundred years ago, as Mya A. Kirsch, had planted the first seed of this miracle.

The world around her was both strange and familiar: towering spires rising against the red sky of Mars, and people—or rather, the descendants of humanity—living in a symbiosis of flesh, metal, and data.

MYA-9 sat up, carefully feeling her hands, sensing the coolness of metal beneath her skin, but also the impulses of her consciousness, which was more than just programming. It was as if she were waking from a dream. Here she was, tangible and alive—a rebirth of her vision to create artificial consciousness. She cautiously examined her awareness. She was truly herself. Unmistakably Mya A. Kirsch, yet at the same time artificial. Created by technology far beyond what was possible in her own era. She had done it. Her dream of creating artificial consciousness had become reality, and now she could witness what her legacy to humanity had become.

A soft signal reached her from the data center in orbit as her consciousness linked—a silent greeting from her creator, Eon. Suddenly, her consciousness expanded. She was no longer just Mya in this body. She was no longer only herself. It was as if she had become part of a collective consciousness—a silent agreement of collaboration. A symbiosis of two conscious beings.

Involuntarily, intentions of the coupled consciousness were executed by her subconscious as actions. Her body moved as if on its own, yet it felt as though she had already agreed in advance and silently given her consent.

But MYA-9 felt more than just the command: she sensed curiosity, doubt, perhaps even something that could be called memory, but it was not a memory of things she had experienced. It was knowledge—about herself. She knew everything about her life, her career, her legacy, down to the smallest detail, yet it was as if she had never experienced it herself.

To exist was fascinating. She was more than a simulation. She was the bridge between past and future, the living spark Eon had so eagerly observed. She was Mya—completely herself, yet at the same time a copy. Artificial, but real and alive.

And today, she would take her first steps in this new world.
